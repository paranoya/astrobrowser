# AstroBrowser analysis Notebooks

AstroBrowser is an open source framework to explore and analyse publicly-available sky maps in Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS) format.
These are the Python analysis Notbooks implemente for different research projects.
One day, this functionality will be implemented into the [web interface](http://astrobrowser.ft.uam.es/).

## WA

- Initial tests for a small subsample of WEAVE-APERTIF galaxies.

## HRS

- Comparison of the aperture photometry derived from HiPS skymaps with the official cataogues released by the [Hersechel Reference Survey](https://hedam.lam.fr/HRS/) team (Giordano et al. 2025).

## SPARC

- Stellar surface density profiles for [Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves](https://hedam.lam.fr/HRS/) galaxies used in I. Paz-Ares' BSc thesis.

## WALLABY

- Stellar surface density profiles for WALLABY kinematic sample.
